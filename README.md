# Sweep

This is a Minesweeper game written in React as a learning exercise. 

It uses no React libraries or dependencies & includes custom CSS rather than using a UI Kit such as Material UI since it is an exercise in frontend dev from first principles. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone the project and run `npm start`.
The app will be available in dev mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.
